An AES-driven IDO-layer data replication system for Syteline, that lets administrators set up event driven replication rules, external target systems, and even field-level data mapping/transformation.

Current targets include:

* Azure EventHubs
* Salesforce REST API

Future potential targets:

* Other Syteline instances through REST or SOAP APIs
* Direct SQL databases (PostGres, MS SQL Server, MySQL, etc)
* Other ERP systems with a REST API?
